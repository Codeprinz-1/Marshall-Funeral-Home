          <h2>The Grieving Process</h2>
          <p>
            Every person is unique in the way he or she handles the loss of a
            loved one. While the grieving process is different for each of us,
            we all experience some common feelings as we work toward healing
            from our loss.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our responses to the different feelings that occur during the
            grieving process are often described as “stages.” These stages are
            not tied down to “real time”, and people do not necessarily move in
            and out of the stages in an orderly, straightforward manner. Stages
            can last for minutes or hours. It is not unusual to move into and
            out of one stage and then to another, and cycle back again to the
            first one. You may find yourself repeating this process a number of
            times as you continue to work through your grief.
            <br />
            <br />
            There are five commonly observed stages that people experience
            during the grieving process. These stages are denial, anger,
            bargaining, depression, and acceptance.
            <br />
            <br />
            At the beginning, you may feel a sense of detachment, shock, or
            numbness. You may even wonder why you are not more upset over your
            loss. This feeling of disconnection is a survival response. It is
            simply nature's way of helping you to continue to function on a
            basic level while under extreme stress. Denial is a tool that
            unconsciously enables you to do the things that are necessary to
            carry on with your life in the days immediately following your loss.
          </p>
          <img
            src="../Images/header-image-grievingprocess.jpg"
            alt="drief support"
          />
          <p>
            Anger provides a bridge of connection from the initial numbness of
            grief. You may find yourself angry at the doctors, your family, the
            loved one who died, or at God. Anger is a necessary stage of the
            healing process. Your anger is connected to your pain. The more you
            truly allow yourself to feel your anger alongside the pain, the more
            it will diminish, and the more you will heal.
            <br />
            <br />
            Before and after a loss, you may feel like you would have done
            anything if only your loved one would be spared. “If only” and “what
            if” becomes a recurrent thought. Guilt often accompanies bargaining.
            You may wonder if you could have done anything differently so that
            your loved one might still be alive. You may try to second-guess the
            doctors and yourself. You may revert to living in the past to avoid
            the pain of the present.
            <br />
            <br />
            After bargaining, feelings of emptiness and grief present themselves
            on a deeper level. This depression is not a sign of mental illness.
            It is the appropriate response to a great loss. When a loss fully
            settles in your soul, and you realize that your loved one is not
            coming back, feelings of deep sadness (depression) are normal. To
            not experience depression after a loved one dies would be very
            unusual. Depression is a necessary step toward healing.
            <br />
            <br />
            Eventually you come to terms with your bereavement as you move into
            the acceptance stage of grief. At this point, the loss has become
            part of your story and your history. It does not consume your life
            in the same way it did to begin with. With acceptance comes
            increased peace. As you move through this stage, you will find
            yourself once more interested in and able to enjoy some of the
            things that you formerly liked to do. You may develop new interests
            and relationships. You have learned to live with your loss in a way
            that is constructive and healing.
          </p>
          <p>How long am I going to feel this way?</p>
          <p>
            Every person is different, and so is their grief. Each person will
            follow a different path toward healing. Although there is no right
            or wrong amount of time to complete the grieving process, many
            experts agree that it is not unusual to take at least a year to move
            through the grieving process.
          </p>
          <p>Complicated grief</p>
          <p>
            The duration of the mourning process can also be influenced by your
            relationship to the deceased, the amount of support you receive, and
            other factors.
            <br />
            Sometimes the healing process may become disrupted or delayed if
            other events or traumatic losses have previously occurred in a
            person’s life. This may be especially true if the other loss is
            relatively recent, or has never been fully processed in and of
            itself. This grief experience is known as “complicated grief.”
            People who are dealing with this type of grief may benefit by
            working with professionals who are trained in dealing with complex
            grief issues. If, after some time has passed, you find your grief is
            still persistent and disruptive to the point where it impacts your
            daily functions, please seek professional counseling.

          <h2>Children & Grief</h2>
          <p>
            Death is a natural event. Experts agree that children, even the very
            young, should not be shielded from the death of a loved one.
            Children have the capacity to recognize death as an event and the
            curiosity to ask questions about the event. The general advice is to
            talk to the child simply and truthfully about the death, in an
            age-appropriate manner.
            <br />
            <br />
            Ask questions to determine what the child already knows about the
            situation. You may then explain the situation to him simply and
            honestly. For instance, you may say, “Grandma’s heart got too tired
            and stopped working, so she died.”
            <br />
            <br />
            It is important to avoid giving answers that may confuse or frighten
            the child, such as “Grandma went to sleep and is not going to wake
            up” or “God took Grandma to be with the angels.” While these phrases
            are meant to comfort and soothe, the child may actually interpret
            them in a far more literal sense. For example, the child might
            develop a fear of going to sleep because the same thing might happen
            to him.
            <br />
            <br />
            Allow the child to ask questions if he wants, but do not pressure
            him if he doesn’t respond. A younger child may ask questions such as
            “Where is Grandma now?” or “Is my kitty in heaven?” Older children
            may comprehend the finality of death more fully, and ask more
            abstract questions that are related to issues of faith, the meaning
            of life, etc.
            <br />
            <br />
            For any age group, stick with truthful, simple answers in terms that
            the child can understand.
          </p>

          <h2>How do you explain the death of a loved one to a child?</h2>
          <p>
            The age and emotional development of a child will influence the way
            they experience grief.
          </p>
          <h2>AGES 2 TO 7</h2>
          <p>
            Up to 7 years of age, children see death mainly as a separation
            event. This may cause them to feel abandoned and scared. They may
            fear being alone, and may not want to sleep alone at night, or go to
            school.
            <br />
            <br />
            Because children this young are usually not skilled at verbally
            expressing their feelings, they may “act out” instead, through
            behaviors such as temper tantrums, refusing to obey adults, or
            creating an imaginary life, accompanied by role-playing. Other
            behaviors, usually manifested by children between the ages of 2 and
            5, may include eating, sleeping, toileting, or bed-wetting problems.
            Very young children under the age of 2 may suddenly refuse to talk,
            and become more irritable in general.
          </p>
          <h2>AGES 7 TO 12</h2>
          <p>
            Children in this age group have begun to understand death asa
            permanent event. They may regard death as a more personal threat to
            their individual safety. They may develop a fear of dying
            themselves. They may resort to “preventive” behaviors to “protect”
            themselves from death, such as aligning themselves with someone they
            think can protect them, or focusing on being “brave” or being
            “good”. Others may simply withdraw socially and/or emotionally from
            others. Symptoms may include problems concentrating on schoolwork,
            trouble following directions, and difficulty in performing daily
            tasks.
          </p>
          <h2>TEENS</h2>
          <p>
            While teenagers understand and perceive death in closely the same
            way as adults, they may express their grief differently. They may
            react in more dramatic ways, or adopt reckless behaviors in an
            attempt to “defy” death. Reckless driving, smoking, drinking
            alcohol, taking illegal drugs, or having unprotected sex may all be
            forms of “acting out” their anxieties and feelings of grief.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thoughts of suicide may sometimes be present in a teen that is
            having trouble processing his or her loss. Warning signs of suicide
            in children and teens may include a preoccupation with death, having
            thoughts or openly talking about suicide, or giving away belongings.
            <br />
            <br />
            Parents of teens who have lost a loved one should be aware of any
            changes in their child’s behavior, and should seek professional
            counseling immediately for the child if they feel their child may be
            in danger.
